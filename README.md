# NewsPaper_Readers_EDA_Prediction
Amid the ongoing digital revolution, it is essential for publishers to comprehend the readership landscape in order to stay pertinent and actively connect with their intended audience.
Nevertheless, it is quite difficult to identify the profiles of readers and individuals who are likely to interact with newspapers and publications.
Publishers may face challenges in adapting their content and marketing strategies to connect with their audience if they lack an understanding of the demographic, behavioural, and socio-economic factors that impact reading habits.
A prominent newspaper aims to enhance reader involvement by comprehending the characteristics of its audience. So conducted an exploratory data analysis and predictive analysis using demographic and socio-economic information gathered from a census to pinpoint the individual traits that define regular readers.

# Data Cleaning and Analysis with Python
## Transitioning to Python, the dataset undergoes rigorous cleaning and transformation steps using libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib:
* Cleaning Data: Handling missing values, duplicates, and correcting data types for accurate analysis.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, trends, and relationships between variables using seaborn and matplotlib to uncover insights.

# Machine Learning Modeling
## Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict newspaper readers:
* Model Selection: Evaluating different algorithms machine learning algorithm.
* Training and Testing: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and using cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
* Performance Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
